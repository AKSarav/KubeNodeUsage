**KubeNodeUsage** is a Terminal App designed to provide insights into Kubernetes node and pod usage. It offers both interactive exploration and command-line filtering options to help you analyze your cluster effectively right from your terminal .

Available to download from `Brew` and `Goinstall`

You no longer have to wait for that `prometheus` and `grafana` - Just check the usage visually right from terminal.

KubeNodeUsage use your local KubeConfig file to connect to the cluster and use Kubernetes API directly using Kubernetes GO SDK

It fetches the Node and Pod Metrics from Kubernetes API and apply filters and aggreations to display it in a nice human readable Graphical format as Bar Charts.



## üåü  Newly added Features ![v3.0.4](https://img.shields.io/badge/v3.0.4-8A2BE2)
- **Smart Search**: Press `S` to instantly filter and highlight matching entries
  - Real-time filtering as you type
  - Headers remain visible for context
  - Match count display
  - Press ESC to exit search mode
- **Horizontal Scrolling**: Use `‚Üê` and `‚Üí` arrows to view wide content
  - Smooth scrolling for large tables
  - Preserves column alignment
- **New Pod Usage**:
  - Now you can see Pod usage in KubeNodeUsage
- **Extra fields in NodeUsage**
  - Thanks to the Horizontal scrolling - we can show more fields like `Uptime` and `Status`
- **More accurate diskusage calculation**
  - Bringing you the accurate diskusage calculation for POD and Node using /stats/summary endpoint in Kubelet



## üöÄ Existing Features 

- Filter output by Node, Color, Label
- Display any specific Node Label as a Custom field
- Metrics are dynamically updated every 2 seconds, so you get the real time data always
- Choose to not display the ClusterInfo for additional security
- No data collected everything is local
- Sorting with Ascending and Descending

### Options for Filtering and Sorting
Perfect for scripting and automation:
- **Node/Pod Filtering**: 
  - `--filternodes`: Filter by node name using regex
  - `--filtercolor`: Filter by usage levels (green/orange/red)
  - `--filterlabel`: Filter by label key-value pairs
- **Sorting Options**:
  - `--sortby`: Sort by various metrics (name, free, usage, etc.)
  - `--desc`: Reverse sort order
- **Display Options**:
  - `--noinfo`: To not display the Cluster information ( can sometimes be confidential ) - Default is to display
  - `--label`: To display a specific lable with custom FieldName

## Kubernetes Supported Versions / Clusters :white_check_mark:

As KubeNodeUsage use the Kubernetes Go SDK and directly connects to the API - It supports all the Kubernetes cluster which supports `.kube/config` file based authentication 

**Clusters**

I have tested it with the following K8s clusters

* EKS - Elastic Kubernetes Service from AWS
* Azure Kubernetes Service
* GKE - Google Kubernetes Engine
* Minikube
* Kind Cluster
* Rancher Kubernetes Engine

**Versions**

I have tested KubeNodeUsage starting from **1.19 - 1.29** ( the latest stable version as of 30th June)

&nbsp; 

## How it Works :bulb:

KubeNodeUsage is written in `GoLang` and uses `client-go` and `kubernetes` SDK libraries

When you start KubeNodeUsage - It try to read the `$HOME/.kube/config` file in your HOME directory

KubeNodeUsage connects to the Default cluster set by the `CurrentContext` on the ./kube/config file

You can manually edit this file and update it but the recommended way to update current-context is to use `kubectl config use-context`

KubeNodeUsage does not use `kubectl` directly and it relies on the `.kube/config` file and the authentication method defined in there

KubeNodeUsage works the same way - kubectl works based on the configuration information found on .kube/config file

If the `kubectl`commands are not working - its highly likely KubeNodeUsage would fail too - In this case you have to check your Kube config file

&nbsp; 

#### Is it secure ? How about Data Privacy :lock:
KubeNodeUsage do not collect any data of your cluster or usage.

## How to Download :arrow_double_down:

You can clone this project and run it as shown below

#### Brew Install üç∫

```
brew tap AKSarav/kubenodeusage
brew install kubenodeusage
```

> Note: If you are using Brew install - You have to use all lowercase letters for the command `kubenodeusage` instead of `KubeNodeUsage` 

#### With GO install command  üöÄ

```
go install github.com/AKSarav/KubeNodeUsage/v3@v3.0.3

```

#### Clone and Run üë®‚Äçüíª

```
git clone https://github.com/AKSarav/KubeNodeUsage.git
cd Kube-Node-Usage
go run main.go
```

#### Download the Binaries from the Release Page üì¶

Goto the https://github.com/AKSarav/KubeNodeUsage/releases and download the suitable binary for your OS and use it
