**KubeNodeUsage** is a Terminal App designed to provide insights into Kubernetes node usage. It offers various options for customization to help you analyze and filter node metrics effectively.

![Alt text](assets/KubeNodeUsage-demo.gif)

KubeNodeUsage use your local KubeConfig file to connect to the cluster and use Kubernetes API directly using Kubernetes GO SDK

It fetches the Node Metrics from Kubernetes API and apply filters and aggreations to display it in a nice human readable Graphical format as Bar Charts.



## Features in NutShell 

KubeNodeUsage helps you to monitor the **CPU**, **Memory** and **Disk** usage of the Nodes in your Kubernetes Cluster

The output can be **sorted**, **filtered**, and **customized** based on your requirements

KubeNodeUsage has different filters to format the output based on the following properties

* NodeName
* Usage 
* Free/Availability of Disk,CPU, Memory
* Max/Capacity of Disk,CPU,Memory
* Color - We use Green, Red and Orange to represent the usage 
  * Green - Below 30% Usage 
  * Orange - Between 30% to 70% Usage
  * Red - Above 70% Usage
* Label - Key Value pair to filter the nodes based on the Label presence on the Node ![v3.0.2](https://img.shields.io/badge/new_on_v3.0.2-8A2BE2)

&nbsp;

All the filtering is controlled by three main flags
- `filternodes` - This is used to filter the nodes based on the Node Name using Regular Expression
- `filtercolor` - This is used to filter the nodes based on the Color Category ( Green, Orange, Red)
- `filterlabel` - This is used to filter the nodes based on the Label Key Value pair ![v3.0.2](https://img.shields.io/badge/new_on_v3.0.2-8A2BE2)

&nbsp;

You can sort the output using following flags
- `sortby` - This is used to sort the output based on the specific metric ( name, free, usage, color, capacity, max)
- `desc` - This is used to sort the output in descending order

By Default KubeNodeUsage prints the Cluster info you can disable it with `--noinfo` flag

If you want to display a specific label as an output - you can use `--label` option with your desired output alias.

We have example commands and screenshots to help you. Feel free to reach out for any help.

&nbsp;

**Additional Key Features include**
* Ability to display the Label information as a new column in the output ![v3.0.2](https://img.shields.io/badge/new_on_v3.0.2-8A2BE2)
* Displaying the Total Pods count in the Cluster ![v3.0.2](https://img.shields.io/badge/new_on_v3.0.2-8A2BE2)
* To Turn off the Cluster Info display ![v3.0.2](https://img.shields.io/badge/new_on_v3.0.2-8A2BE2)
* Label - You can display the Label information as a new column in the output ![v3.0.2](https://img.shields.io/badge/new_on_v3.0.2-8A2BE2)

## Kubernetes Supported Versions / Clusters :white_check_mark:

As KubeNodeUsage use the Kubernetes Go SDK and directly connects to the API - It supports all the Kubernetes cluster which supports `.kube/config` file based authentication 

**Clusters**

I have tested it with the following K8s clusters

* EKS - Elastic Kubernetes Service from AWS
* Azure Kubernetes Service
* GKE - Google Kubernetes Engine
* Minikube
* Kind Cluster

**Versions**

I have tested KubeNodeUsage starting from **1.19 - 1.29** ( the latest stable version as of 30th June)

&nbsp; 

## How it Works :bulb:

KubeNodeUsage is written in `GoLang` and uses `client-go` and `kubernetes` SDK libraries

When you start KubeNodeUsage - It try to read the `$HOME/.kube/config` file in your HOME directory

KubeNodeUsage connects to the Default cluster set by the `CurrentContext` on the ./kube/config file

You can manually edit this file and update it but the recommended way to update current-context is to use `kubectl config use-context`

KubeNodeUsage does not use `kubectl` directly and it relies on the `.kube/config` file and the authentication method defined in there

KubeNodeUsage works the same way - kubectl works based on the configuration information found on .kube/config file

If the `kubectl`commands are not working - its highly likely KubeNodeUsage would fail too - In this case you have to check your Kube config file

#### Is it secure ? How about Data Privacy :lock:
KubeNodeUsage do not collect any data or send anywhere 

KubeNodeUsage Source code is Public, Feel free to download and validate it yourself
&nbsp;

## How to Download :arrow_double_down:

You can clone this project and run it as shown below

#### Brew Install üç∫

```
brew tap AKSarav/kubenodeusage
brew install kubenodeusage
```

> Note: If you are using Brew install - You have to use all lowercase letters for the command `kubenodeusage` instead of `KubeNodeUsage` 

#### With GO install command  üöÄ

```
go install github.com/AKSarav/KubeNodeUsage/v3@v3.0.3

## How to use :book:

KubeNodeUsage is a command line utility with lot of startup options/flags 


```bash
KubeNodeUsage [options]
```

You can find the detail information on all available options here

&nbsp;
**Available Options** :memo:

- `metrics`: Choose which metric to display. Valid options include:

    - memory
    - disk
